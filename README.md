__DEPRECATED__

This is a proof of concept for an RPG style game supported by the RPG Maker VX Ace engine.

Due to discovered resolution limitations imposed by VX Ace, we've decided to upgrade the project to RPG Maker MV.

This code remains as a reference to the ruby code we've updated to javascript, but continued work will take place in our private repository containing the MV code.
